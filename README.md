# automated-evaluation-of-subjective-questions
This project aims to transform the examination process into the one that requires minimal amount of human intervention by building an automated test platform application with proper user authentication mechanism. This application can be used to conduct both objective and subjective based tests. The Question-Answer pairs are composed dynamically from the subjective information provided, through natural language processing techniques. The evaluation of subjective answers and resultant score generation takes place using the cosine similarity metric. The obtained scores are recorded in the relevant data files automatically, to perform the rank-based analysis in future. The grading system has also been incorporated in the application to segregate various responses in a better manner. This flask-based web application, as a whole, helps in the effective and efficient utilization of resources by the examination body and saves the instructor time considerably.
